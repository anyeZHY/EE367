# EE367

 [Stanford EE367 / CS448I: Computational Imaging](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee367/)

## 简介

该 repository 用于记录我对 Stanford EE367 课程作业的实现。

## Implementation

- Homework 1: completed on Feb. 22, 2022
- Homework 2: completed on Mar. 9, 2022
  - The implementation of NLM is naive and not vectorized.
  - NB: 'for' in Python may lead to much running time. (M1 Mac: 5 minutes.)

## Misc

*The Repo is shelved temporarily.* Now I am learning CS229 and CS231n.
